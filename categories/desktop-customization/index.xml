Turned out the first part was not as bad as I expected as I&amp;rsquo;ve found some tools on the net to do this and Kris helped with the tool to convert the images in the proprietary format into TGA&amp;rsquo;s. Now here&amp;rsquo;s where the pain begun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At first it may seem a tedious job but once you have all the frames, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing I did in my research was asking the experts. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked some of the skin authors and most of them uses a kind of workaround to this. The most detailed explanation I&amp;rsquo;ve received from one of the greatest WindowBlinds skinners - &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikeb314.wincustomize.com/&#34;&gt;Mike Bryant&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;could-we-have-some-decency-here&#34;&gt;Could we have some decency here?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adam.wincustomize.com/Articles.aspx--SID=59&amp;amp;AID=33940&amp;amp;c=1&#34; title=&#34;Originally posted on another site&#34;&gt;Originally posted on Wincustomize.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of noise in the news sites (&lt;a href=&#34;http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/11/05/1324254.shtml&#34;&gt;Slashdot.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.com.com/Mac+developer+looks+to+Windows+to+escape+Tiger/2100-1046_3-5439243.html?tag=nefd.top&#34;&gt;News.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=25393&amp;amp;category=main&#34;&gt;Neowin.net&lt;/a&gt;) about the Monday release of Konfabulator for Windows. But to be honest they just make me think that journalists today no longer care to be through and accurate and will chew in everything  that a PR department will send them. I do not personally rant about those kind of things, but this one got me going. Especially one thing Mr Alro said which is cited in about all of the sources:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adam.joeuser.com/article/275/The_power_of_clipboard&#34; title=&#34;Originally posted on another site&#34;&gt;Originally posted on JoeUser.com&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;A few days back I found that nice Visual Style. Really easy on eyes - perfect for coding - titlebar not to high - not too many distractions. So i ran it through Skinstudio, added a few mods to make it the nice place to look and shown it to Pas (Snidely Whiplash). He&amp;rsquo;s made a couple of mods himself and I wanted to have them in my skin. But my skin was USF (yes you can apply USF skins to WindowBlinds with Skinstudio) and his was WindowBlinds. But the image format is the same, so i could just copy it and change the settings in my skin. But how would i do that without wasting an hour chasing all the attributes that needs to be changed? So i came up with 2 easy features to do that.&#xA;Extract from the change log:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
